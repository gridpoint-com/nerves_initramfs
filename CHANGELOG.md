## v0.4.0

* New features
  * Add `file-to-cpio.sh` helper script to release so that systems using
    `nerves_initramfs` don't need to maintain a copy.
  * fwup v1.7.0

## v0.3.3

* New features
  * Change Linux command line override format to actually work. New format is
    to pass `--` and then `key` or `key=value` parameters. For example,
    `-- rootfs.path=/dev/sda2 run_repl`
  * Create /dev/rootdisk symlinks - These are used various places to generically
    refer to the boot block device. Creating them here is more reliable than
    other locations since the symlinks are based on the nerves_initramfs
    configuration rather than trying to derive them from mount information.
  * Buildroot 2020.02
  * fwup v1.5.2 - footprint reductions

* Bug fixes
  * Fix block calculation for call to device mapper

  * Fix bug where uboot environment reads would not wait for the target disk to
